1. Navigate to Settings > System > About phone.

###### ENABLE INSTALLING "UNKOWN APPS" ON ANDROID OREO
1. Go to Settings.

2. Then Apps and Notifications.

3. Select Install Unknown Apps (or Install Other Apps).

* ### Install an android file manager
Now that you've configured your phone to let you install unknown apps, you'll also need a way to find that application file (APK file) on your phone so you can run it.

Android phones typically come with a "File Manager" app you can use. But if you don't have one, then open Google Play on your phone and search for "File Manager." You'll see lots of options available.

Some of the best options include:
* Cx File Explorer
* EZ File Explorer
* File Manager

The download of the latest apk version of the project is available on the [release tab](https://github.com/Mikael-R/Depe-Mobile/releases). After downloading, enter the downloads folder with your file manager and click to install.
